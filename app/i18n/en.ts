My interests go from videogames, to traditional art, from web development to dancing. \n You may ask why AKAI? Well, it means red in Japanese and I can't see myself without this color in my life as it perfectly represents me. \n Talking about art, it was always very important in my life since I was a kid. Through my whole life, I kept a pencil in my hands, I was drawing in my notebooks, in my books, and on the desks. /n Now finally it's not just a hobby, but also my job!",
